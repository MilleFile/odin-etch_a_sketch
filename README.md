The fourth project from The Odin Project

Notes after completion: 

Making everything work in flexbox was based around a miconception I had, which is that it would be simpler to treat each pixel on the grid seperately, and sort using flexbox methods and attributes. Changing the approach to rows of these pixels was trivial, but immediately solved all grid issues. Taking a step back is crucial when frustrated.

That said, flexbox on all the elements does make it look way nicer than stock attributes.

There are optimizations, like the unnecessary call to remove a class when it can't be there, but this isn't necessarily about long term building than producing a viable product.
